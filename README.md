### üîç About Me
I vividly remember being awed by a flip phone my father had gotten. I believe that is where it all started.

**I'm out to master all aspects of Web Development** ‚Äî I want to make the process of idea to implementation as frictionless as possible. While I enjoy working across the stack, I find myself drawn towards the server-side more.

From that flip phone, I graduated to tweaking Windows (thought I knew it all!), became the family tech guru, and flashed custom ROMs on Android phones just for fun.
In high school, I still hadn't taken programming seriously. I was going through some frequently asked C programs at 9 PM before finals, after ignoring it all year. Despite barely passing, those two hours unexpectedly got me hooked.

It led me to pursue Bacholer's degree in Education and Computer Science and Information Technology (B.Ed CSIT). During my bacholer's, I landed an internship at a local software media company where I was introduced to Python, Django, and Linux.
I loved the idea of developing for one platform and having it accessible on anything with a browser. That experience led me to pursue a postgraduate diploma in Web Development down the line.

I feel at home in a Linux environment with a terminal-based workflow. I run with a tiling window manager and (Neo)Vim as my editor for peak performance.

Some technologies I frequently use are:
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Django, FastAPI, Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: React, Remix
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB
- **DevOps**: Linux, Git, Docker, Vagrant
- **Tools**: Neovim, Bash
